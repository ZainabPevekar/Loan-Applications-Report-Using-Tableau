DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY
"In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. 
This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. 
The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW
In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. 
These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters.

DASHBOARD 3: DETAILS
In our Bank Loan Report project, we recognize the need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. 
This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.
